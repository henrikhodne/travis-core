# Build currently models a central but rather abstract domain entity: the thing
# that is triggered by a Github request (service hook ping).
#
# Build groups a matrix of Job::Test instances, and belongs to a Request (and
# thus Commit as well as a Repository).
#
# A Build is created when its Request was configured (by fetching .travis.yml)
# and approved (e.g. not excluded by the configuration). Once a Build is
# created it will expand its matrix according to the given configuration and
# create the according Job::Test instances.  Each Job::Test instance will
# trigger a test run remotely (on the worker). Once all Job::Test instances
# have finished the Build will be finished as well.
#
# Each of these state changes (build:created, job:started, job:finished, ...)
# will issue events that are listened for by the event handlers contained in
# travis/notification. These event handlers then send out various notifications
# of various types through email, pusher and irc, archive builds and queue
# jobs for the workers.
#
# Build is split up to several modules:
#
#  * Build         - ActiveRecord structure, validations and scopes
#  * States        - state definitions and events
#  * Denormalize   - some state changes denormalize attributes to the build's
#                    repository (e.g. Build#started_at gets propagated to
#                    Repository#last_started_at)
#  * Matrix        - logic related to expanding the build matrix, normalizing
#                    configuration for Job::Test instances, evaluating the
#                    final build result etc.
#  * Messages      - helpers for evaluating human readable result messages
#                    (e.g. "Still Failing")
#  * Notifications - helpers that are used by notification handlers (and that
#                    TODO probably should be cleaned up and moved to
#                    travis/notification)
